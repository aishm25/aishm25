Hi there 👋, my name is Aishwarya  
Welcome to my GitHub Profile  

I have completed a Master’s in Data Architecture and Management and currently work as a BI Developer. I am actively enhancing my skills in Data Engineering by building hands-on projects that focus on designing scalable data pipelines, working with cloud data platforms, and transforming raw data into analytics-ready datasets. Most of the projects here are created as part of my learning journey, where I apply concepts in SQL, PySpark, and Databricks to solve real-world data problems and strengthen my understanding of end-to-end data engineering workflows.
